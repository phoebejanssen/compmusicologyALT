What does it mean to be Alternative on Spotify?

Latest after my first class of my BA and the first of many classes on genre theory, 
I threw the belief out of the window that geners were the way to categorise music. 
Nonetheless, I frequently use those genre terms I deemed to be useless descriptors 
on a regular basis. Some terms relate to musicla qualities, others to the geographical 
or cultural origins, others to their target audience. Genres such as Pop or Rock 
might seem straightforward but the more you try to find a common ground the less you
actually find it. In this project I will focuss on the term 'Alternative' and how 
Spotify interprets it across multiple decades. What is it an alternative to? 
What makes it alternative? What used to eb alternative and is now common practice?
To do so I will analyse each decade's Alternative playlist made by Spotify and the 
two playlists "Early Alternative" and "New Alternative". Currrently there are playlists 
available for every decade starting from the 1960s. In total I will be looking at 
and comparing 8 playlists. "New Alternative" is a weekly changing playlist. My current
aim is to use two, maybe three versions of this playlist. 

So far, the danceability and speechiness of the songs seem to be the most promising
variables to analyse. 


I am still struggling with the connection on github and rstudio and I've been basically knocked out since Tuesday hence no visualisations so far on this page.
